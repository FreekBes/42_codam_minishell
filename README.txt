- replace  write / printf errors with our custom fd_putstring function
- if a path contains a / character, assume it's absolute or relative and try and access the file, DO NOT look in path and if it does not, then only check path
- send environment variables with execve
- make "'"' work: should have an ' as one argument and then error out because of an unclosed ' parameter
- //// Ctrl + C should not clear the entire command, should only remove the ^C (should it really?)
- test with: "< /usr/share/dict/words cat | cat > out" (should not get stuck)
- ioctl to check pipe byte limit
- check if single quote is in between double quotes for envar parsing
- envar parsing: test=b, test=b$test should set test to bb... but $test=a should not set b to a. for first thing, can use parse_envars with the string to set it to, should work as long as it's allocated
