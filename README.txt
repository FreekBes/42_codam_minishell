- replace  write / printf errors with our custom fd_putstring function
- if a path contains a / character, assume it's absolute or relative and try and access the file, DO NOT look in path and if it does not, then only check path
- add support for export var_name after setting var_name with just var_name=value (setting it without export)
- send environment variables with execve
- fix line overflow in readline
- make "'"' work: should have an ' as one argument and then error out because of an unclosed ' parameter
- Ctrl + C should not clear the entire command, should only remove the ^C
- test with: "< /usr/share/dict/words cat | cat > out" (should not get stuck)
- ioctl to check pipe byte limit
