- replace  write / printf errors with our custom fd_putstring function
- if a path contains a / character, assume it's absolute or relative and try and access the file, DO NOT look in path and if it does not, then only check path
- send environment variables with execve
- make "'"' work: should have an ' as one argument and then error out because of an unclosed ' parameter
- //// Ctrl + C should not clear the entire command, should only remove the ^C (should it really?)
- test with: "< /usr/share/dict/words cat | cat > out" (should not get stuck)
- ioctl to check pipe byte limit
- check if we need to implement $PPID
- do we need to implement 2>&1 etc
- CD : child checks access to directory, if not prints error (this way stderr redirections are set correctly), then error code is passed to parent 
2<src/main.c 2>output cat
