- If the path in ENV is unset or changed, change the path in mini also
- replace  write / printf errors with our custom fd_putstring function
- if a path contains a / character, assume it's absolute or relative and try and access the file, DO NOT look in path and if it does not, then only check path
- add support for export var_name after setting var_name with just var_name=value (setting it without export)
- send environment variables with execve
- escape characters should work, even outside of double quotes (echo \")
